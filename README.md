# BoxBreathing

A simple web app that guides you through the box breathing technique—inhale, hold, exhale, hold—all in a calm little loop.

## Design Philosophy

BoxBreathing is intentionally minimal.
Instead of a loud UI or distracting graphics, it displays a soft, glowing strip positioned just behind your taskbar. The strip pulses gently to guide your breathing rhythm—inhale, hold, exhale, hold—without pulling focus from your screen.
It’s designed to be ambient, almost invisible. The goal is to let you choose when to tune in and sync with it, encouraging awareness and nervous system regulation without demanding your attention.
Sometimes doing less *is* the feature.

## Features

- 3s breathing intervals (customizable in the future)
- Calming visual animations

## How to Run

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio

3. The setup window will appear with Start/Stop buttons
4. Click "Start" to begin the breathing animation
