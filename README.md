# BoxBreathing

A minimal desktop breathing strip to help regulate your breath and calm your nervous system.

This WPF application shows a glowing bar at the bottom of your screen that follows a 4-phase breathing pattern:

- Inhale (3s)
- Pause (3s)
- Exhale (3s)
- Pause (3s)

The strip changes opacity and color as it guides you through the rhythm.
It's subtle, non-distracting, and designed to be a passive visual cue for breathing awareness.
